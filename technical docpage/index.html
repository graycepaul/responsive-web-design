          Web performance is a critical aspect of frontend engineering that
          directly impacts user experience and overall satisfaction. This
          documentation aims to provide frontend engineers with a comprehensive
          guide on optimizing web performance, covering strategies, tools, and
          best practices to enhance the speed and responsiveness of web
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding and implementing <code>WebAssembly</code> is also
          becoming increasingly relevant for performance improvements, allowing
          certain computation-heavy tasks to be offloaded to the client-side.

          Understanding and measuring performance metrics are essential for
          identifying areas of improvement. This section covers key metrics such
          as <code>Page Load Time (PLT)</code>,
          <code>Time to First Byte (TTFB)</code>,
          <code>First Contentful Paint (FCP)</code>, and
          <code>Time to Interactive (TTI)</code>. Utilizing efficient algorithms
          and data structures, denoted within <code>script</code> and
          <code>style</code> elements, can significantly contribute to reducing
          these critical metrics.

        <p>
          To optimize web performance, consider strategies such as
          <code>Minification</code> and <code>Compression</code> of CSS,
          JavaScript, and images, as well as implementing
          <code>Asynchronous Loading</code> and <code>Lazy Loading</code>.
          Integration of <code>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</code> and
          effective <code>Caching Mechanisms</code> using
          <code>service workers</code> can significantly enhance performance.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Asynchronous Loading:</span>
              Load non-essential scripts and resources asynchronously to prevent
              blocking the rendering of the page.
